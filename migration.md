# Service deprecation

Over the past few months we have been working hard on upgradesÂ to our infrastructure in order to develop a more
sustainable and scalable architecture.

With this work nearing completion, most of our current services are now **deprecated** and will become **permanently
inaccessible** after the **31st of October 2020**.

## What does this mean for me?

The most important bits:

  - Download anything stored on `spoon` or `cube`, including your webspace. You can log in with your existing account
    details. Everything will be **deleted** after 2020-10-31!
  - Sign up for a new Netsoc account <a href="https://accounts.netsoc.ie/signup" target="_blank">here</a> with your
    existing username (you'll need an admin to help you with this, as _all current Netsoc usernames have been reserved_ -
    email [support@netsoc.ie](mailto:support@netsoc.ie). You can sign up with a different username and we can change
    your username back to the existing one)
  - Migrate your website to next-gen webspaces (details to come over the next few weeks!)
  - Matrix chat accounts and history will remain, _but_ will require a 2020 Netsoc account after the **2nd of October**
  (make sure to sign up with your existing username!)

## Next-gen webspaces?

Current web hosting will be replaced by the long-awaited next-gen release (re-written from the prototype developed in
2019 to be more stable!). Every user will have their own dedicated VM-style machine to install whatever they like!
Since they're just Linux machines, you'll be able storeÂ files in your new webspace, butÂ existing data will not be
migrated automatically!

We're still working on the final infrastructure for new webspaces, but we'll be updating this page (and sending out
notifications) when everything is ready.

_We apologise for the inconvenience this will cause but we firmly believe that this migration will deliver a
significantly better user experience and allow us to better maintain our servers and services in the future._
