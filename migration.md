# Old user migration guide

If you were a member of Netsoc before the 2020/2021 academic year (on our old infrastructure), your username was
reserved. This means you won't be able to sign up directly with your old account.

**Please sign up under a different username and then [email support](mailto:support@netsoc.ie) - we'll be able to give
you back your old username.**
